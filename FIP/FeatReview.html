            <p>There isn’t anyone who doesn’t want the best for themselves, and especially in the case of using a mobile phone, everyone wants something that meet all their tech needs and make their life easier.</p>
            <p>iPhone has owned the name for bringing out the best smartphones for a long time, but in recent years, Androids phones came up with the innovations and features that Apple didn’t have and paved their way of owning the title of being the best phone too. So, every 2-3 year, every smartphone company prepare new innovative design with new feature to beat the previous best phone title holder. It’s like a gamble, sometimes it’s a success and sometimes it’s a huge loss, mainly resulting in companies quitting the mobile business. Just like that, Apple launched iPhone 12 series in October 2020, and the iPhone pro max became the best phone of the year (which it is still caring till this day). The whole internet is filled up with the praise for this new model and the explanation of how they get to that result.</p>
            <p>iPhone 12 Pro Max is a 6.33 by 3.07 by .29 inches wide and long phone with 6.7 inches display and 2,778 by 1,284 pixels screen resolution. It comes with a IOS 14 and Apple A14 chip as a CPU. Along with its CPU and IOS, which has been considered the best features of the phone, it also includes 12MP, 12MP, 12MP; 12MP (Rear; Front-Facing) camera resolution which makes photography and videography able to be shoot in 4K with high quality and cinematic affects.</p>

                <img style="object-fit: contain; width: 500px;" src="images/review-page-pics/iphone-review-pic-2.jpg" alt="Iphone Package details">
                <p>The packaging includes the iPhone 12 Pro Max, manual with (FREE) stickers and a USB-C cable. 
                    Furthermore, the Pro Max has dual-SIM capabilities with one SIM being eSIM for loading a second subscription or number while travelling. It can also handle any form of 4G or 5G available in North America (US & CAN).

            <p class="bold-text">But even with these great features, does an average person really need this phone?</p>
            <p>An average person in this age needs a device that make their work done fast and efficiently while their being fully updated to the world’s latest technology. With this coming age, these types of devices are easily available with latest feature while being inexpensive. So why a need to spend $1,549.99 Canadians Dollars on a phone that does the same job as every other phone?</p>
            <p>Yes, it is true that iPhone have great feature, but those features are nearly useless for an average person. People usually don’t 4K camera in the first place. It could also be said that the concept of iPhone Pro Max being a smartphone is wrong itself. It usually looks more like a replacement for high tech-camera stuff that is way too expensive to buy and heavy to carry around everywhere. This point could be proven by Pro Max’s body design flaw which is way too big to fit into hands, and the boxy sharp edging makes it uncomfortable to hold the device at all. It is designed to be standing rather than being held into hand easily, which shows that Pro Max wasn’t designed to be average user friendly. </p>
            <p>If you have more than $1000 to spend for device, or like big screens and keyboard, and a photography/videography geek who is unable to afford expensive DSLRS/cinematic cameras, then sure you are not an average user and are welcome to buy your dream device.</p>
